# 🧹 Projects Folder Cleanup Complete!

## ✅ What Was Cleaned Up

Removed duplicate and unused project files from the `projects/` folder:

### Files Removed:
- ❌ `dev-project-new.yaml` (duplicate)
- ❌ `uat-project-new.yaml` (duplicate) 
- ❌ `prod-project-new.yaml` (duplicate)

### Files Kept:
- ✅ `dev-project.yaml` (active)
- ✅ `uat-project.yaml` (active)
- ✅ `prod-project.yaml` (active, currently deployed)

## 📂 Clean Project Structure

```
projects/
├── dev-project.yaml     # Development environment RBAC & policies
├── uat-project.yaml     # UAT environment RBAC & policies
└── prod-project.yaml    # Production environment RBAC & policies
```

## 🔗 Script References Verified

All deployment scripts correctly reference the clean project files:

✅ `clusters/dev/deploy-dev.sh` → `projects/dev-project.yaml`
✅ `clusters/uat/deploy-uat.sh` → `projects/uat-project.yaml`
✅ `clusters/prod/deploy-prod.sh` → `projects/prod-project.yaml`
✅ `deploy.sh` → `projects/prod-project.yaml`

## 🛡️ Current Production State

Currently deployed in your production cluster:
```bash
kubectl get appprojects -n argocd
# NAME           AGE
# default        9d
# myproject      41h
# prod-project   39h  ← Active production project
```

## 🎯 Benefits

✅ **Clean Repository**: No duplicate or confusing files
✅ **Clear Structure**: Easy to understand which projects are active
✅ **Consistent Naming**: All files follow the same pattern
✅ **Reduced Maintenance**: Fewer files to manage and update

The projects folder is now clean and follows best practices! 🚀
